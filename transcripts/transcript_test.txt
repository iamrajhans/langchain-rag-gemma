The Rule of 100 is a tool used by financial professionals to
provide you with general guidelines for proper allocation of
your retirement and investment assets. The Rule of 100 takes
into consideration your age and investment time horizon to
better define your risk tolerance. The results of this analysis
can be used to determine how much of your retirement and
investment assets should be exposed to risk and loss.
The Rule of 100 uses your age as a baseline in the calculation
to appropriately allocate assets. The calculation begins with
the number 100. Subtracting your age from 100 provides an
immediate snapshot of what percentage of your retirement
assets should be in the market (at risk) and what percentage
of your retirement assets should be in safe money (no risk)
alternatives. Adjustments are then applied through a detailed
risk analysis to ensure you’re recommendation is based on your
unique tolerance to risk. This strategy will reduce your exposure
to undesirable market risk and the volatile market swings that
most people experienced in 2008 resulting in significant loss.
Example: A 65 year old client has $100,000 saved for retirement.
To apply The Rule of 100, start with 100 and subtract 65 to
leave a remaining value of 35. In this example, the client should
have no more than 35%, or $35,000, of his or her assets at risk
in stocks or equities. This leaves 65%, or $65,000, of his or her
assets to be allocated to safe money alternatives.
Let us presume that the client within this example had 100%
of their assets invested in the stock market. If the market
declined 40%, a significant portion of their nest egg would have
experienced a loss. It will take a 66.6% return on investments
to regain their original principal. Applying The Rule of 100 to
asset allocation could have dramatically reduced the client’s
portfolio losses.
Don’t overlook your risk exposure within your asset allocation.
Asset allocation is a critical component to your overall financial
plan and can have a dramatic impact on your retirement future.
